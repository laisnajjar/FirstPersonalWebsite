                    Hi! This is sort of <b>exciting</b>, right? I'm just <a>playing</a> around with the <i> style </i> and I'm getting <a href="https://memegenerator.net/instance/58086921/kevin-hart-whoa-lets-not-get-carried-away"> carried away</a>

                    My name is pronounced like the shoe lace - unfortunate way of explaining it.
                    I'm a rising sophmore at the University of Michigan majoring in computer science.
                    In my free time, I love playing chess - add me on chess.com if you have a brave soul (shamwow12345) - and I love to read; here's what I'm currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Men-Without-Women-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0451494628">reading</a>.

                    I'm on umich's men's gymnastics team and I also compete internationally for Syria. My biggest achievements have been
                    becoming a <b> world cup medalist</b> and qualifing to World Championships. One day, I hope to qualify for the Olympics.

                    Can you guess my favorite color?
